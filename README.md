# What is this ??????

A new and awful implementation of Thierry Coquand et. al's Mini-TT language :)

The main algorithm is in `tc.rkt`, and there is some work that I'm doing to write some 
documentation of what *exactly* is going on; but this was really fun to work on and 
I have become, if only a little, slightly more confident in what the hell is going on with 
type checking :)
